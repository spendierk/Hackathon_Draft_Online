    "This was a first glimpse of the workflow from the design of a quantum circuit to its execution. There is much more to discover by looking at an entire series of example notebooks for `pytket`\n",

    "Recommended examples applicable to this Hackathon you can go through as a continuation of this introduction include:\n",

    "- [Circuit Optimization](https://github.com/CQCL/pytket/blob/master/examples/compilation_example.ipynb)\n",

    "For this hackathon, we have prepared two different tasks that you can try to\n",
    "tackle with TKET:\n",
    " 1. \"[Estimating phases with Hadamard Test and Cat States](https://github.com/CQCL/ethz-hackathon22/blob/main/hadamard_test.md)\". This problem explores some of the more theoretical questions around building applications of quantum computing for quantum chemistry and Hamiltonian simulation. A bit more maths and physics heavy.\n",
    " 2. \"[World-class routing](https://github.com/CQCL/ethz-hackathon22/blob/main/routing.md)\". Dive into the state-of-the-art of quantum circuit compilation. This problem is more applied, open-ended and programming-heavy: you'll have to come up with your own implementations and benchmark your results.\n",
