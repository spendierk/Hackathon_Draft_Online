# Welcome the TKET Hackathon - DRAFT!!!

On behalf of Quantinuum, welcome to the TKET Hackathon! This little guide should get you started quickly in `pytket`, a high-performance Python library for building and simplifying quantum programs.

TKET is a quantum software toolkit designed to compile and optimize quantum programs. It is platform agnostic allowing it to target a range of quantum hardware and classical simulators. TKET can improve the performance of NISQ algorithms by optimizing quantum circuits.

The content of this hackathon manual is as follows:

If any questions arise during the hackathon, don't hesitate to contact me on Slack or by email if you prefer!
