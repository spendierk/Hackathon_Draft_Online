    "The costs for using quantum hardware platforms depend on different parameters such as runtime, the number of gates in a program, the complexity of the gates used, and the number of shots. Based on the known pricing of different gate-based quantum computing hardware providers, you are tasked to find the cheapest solution for your company to perform a selection of quantum computations. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this challenge, you will use the TKET compiler, which integrates with Qiskit. TKET is a platform agnostic quantum software toolkit that will help you compile and optimize your quantum programs to target a range of hardware and find the most valuable solution for your company. \n",

    " 1. \"[Estimating phases with Hadamard Test and Cat States](hadamard_test.md)\". This problem explores some of the more theoretical questions around building applications of quantum computing for quantum chemistry and Hamiltonian simulation. A bit more maths and physics heavy.\n",
    " 2. \"[World-class routing](routing.md)\". Dive into the state-of-the-art of quantum circuit compilation. This problem is more applied, open-ended and programming-heavy: you'll have to come up with your own implementations and benchmark your results.\n",
