    "[Pytket](https://cqcl.github.io/tket/pytket/api/index.html) is a Python toolkit for quantum programming developed by Cambridge Quantum Computing, an extension of their larger TKET toolchain. TKET encompasses the entire toolset of high-performance tools for quantum programming, primarily written in C++. Hence, `pytket` is a Python interface to TKET, a platform-agnostic quantum software development kit (QSDK).\n",
